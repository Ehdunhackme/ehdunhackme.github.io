# About Me

Perhaps you stumbled here for the red buttons or you're here to stalk me. I mean... the internet always be strange like that.

You can refer to me as Dun Li, Chan, raxec, depending on how you know me. If not, or just call me Dun Li lmao. Just a kid who was born and raised in Penang, Malaysia.

I’m that person who’s always been hooked into science research, whether it's machine learning, astronomy and astrophysics (ah yes, the big & fancy space stuff). When I'm not busy chasing after the mysteries of the universe, I’m probably either debugging code, reading research paper, or getting lost in science Olympiads/fair. 

Free free to poke around my blog and side projects [here](https://github.com/Ehdunhackme). I’d love it if you try hacking them (in a non-destructive way, of course)

I’m all about feedback, so feel free to share your thoughts with me. I’d love to listen! ok bye :P
